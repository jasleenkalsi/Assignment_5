# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
-One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the error handling was comprehensive enough to catch all potential issues with user input.
-Another challenge was maintaining clarity and conciseness in the function documentation while still providing all necessary information.
-Ensuring that the function behaves as expected under various scenarios, such as different types of user input, was also a challenge.

## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
### Benefits:

-Unit tests help ensure that each individual component of the code performs as expected, which contributes to overall code reliability.
-They serve as documentation for how the code is intended to be used, providing clarity to other developers working on the project.
-Unit tests can catch bugs early in the development process, making it easier and less costly to fix them.

### Challenges:

Writing comprehensive unit tests can be time-consuming, especially for complex systems with many components.
Maintaining unit tests can become challenging as the codebase evolves and changes over time, requiring constant updates to the tests.
Unit tests may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases, leading to gaps in test coverage and potentially missed bugs.
